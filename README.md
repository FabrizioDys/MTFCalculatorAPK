# MTFCalculatorAPK
The APK for MTFCalculator. Developed by Fabrizio Lo Presti and Luigi Amato.

Background and goals
MTFCalculator is an application used to evaluate the camera quality of a mobile device through technical notions of the Computer Vision field.
It is common that, once purchased a new smartphone, one has high expectations regarding the performance of the camera; expectations that are often confirmed vaguely, through the taking of a couple photographs or the capturing of a video clip of subjects or environments which do not guarantee a concrete and objective conviction about the result.
Nowadays there are numerous tools that allow to accurately analyze the quality of a photograph, therefore the goal of this application is to provide a numerical value that indicates how properly the device is performing in terms of quality of the shot, applying mathematically consistent formulas.
Target
The application is aimed at a heterogeneous audience, given its easy use and the presence of a user guide: anyone can, by following the on-screen instructions, measure the quality of their device and understand the results. However, some details of the app, such as the technical data sheets on the concepts on which the calculation is based, make it more suitable for an age group over 12.
Operating Systems and Devices
The application is available on Android operating systems and is optimized for Android 9.0.
